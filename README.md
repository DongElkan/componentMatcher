#Component Matcher
---------------
**ComponentMatcher** is a free python package that finds common components between two data derived from hyphenated analytical instruments, for example high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for quality control of herbal medicines. To achieve this, multicomponent spectral correlative chromatography (MSCC) method ([Hu Y, 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15612753)) is used to match chromatographic peaks.

#Prerequisite
--------------
The tool is coded by python, and `matplotlib` and `numpy` are required for data processing. The main codes are run on Python 2.7, but codes for Python 3 are also provided at `py3` branch.


#Usage
--------------------
Double click `CMmain`, and an interface will occur. All data processing can be performed on the interface.  
**NOTE** Currently, only text data files are accepted as input data format.
